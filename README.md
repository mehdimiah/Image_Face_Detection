# Image_Face_Detection
This was my first exposure to open-cv2 and its capabilities, this project was used just for face detection within images.

I have also included a photo of my instructor which can be used to try out the program.

The idea is to use face detection and draw a square around the face found within the image, the speed and accuracy can be edited for darker images ect
